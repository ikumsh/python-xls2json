# XLS -> 2 -> JSON
Here I'm making a python script to take XLSForms & convert them into JSON strings. The JSON may then be used to generate HTML templates for the website.


The project has grown beyond the original scope I had set. Now by launching flask_xls2json.py we can get a website with the xlsform being rendered as an html form.
